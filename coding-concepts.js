// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
// const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))


// a) Your answer: adds "indigo" to the end of the array.
// b) Verify and explain:

//      My guess:


//      The variable colors that is equal to the array with all of the color strings incased in the brackets[].

//      The .push() built-in method adds a value to the end of the array.

//      The value in the array is the string "indigo".

//      So i presume the code will display the the colors in the array with the addition of "indigo" at the end of the array.

//      Incorrect.

//      Correction:

//      To get the answer i explained above, I'd have to add another console.log with the colors variable as the argument.

//      the correct answer was 5 for the total number of strings in the projected code.

//

// --------------------1) What will this log?

// const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 10
// b) Verify and explain: 

//      My guess:

//      I say its going to be 10. The .length function call count in an Index format and it starts at 0 instead on 1. 
//      There is 11 characters in the string so it will the character from 0 to 10. So the answer is 10.

// --------------------2) What will this log?

// const greeting = "Hello World!"
// console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: o
// b) Verify and explain: 

        // My guess:

        // The console.log function call has the variable in the argument with the number 4 in the brackets. The variable
        // reference the string "Hello World". The 4 will count the string in an Index format from 0 to 4 so the answer should be "o"

// --------------------3) What will this log?

// const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
// const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby
// b) Verify and explain:

//  My guess: 

//  We declare the variable "languages" equal to the array.

//  In the argument, we have the index variable that is equal to the value (1).

//  The array is counting the string from an index format from 0 to 1. 

//  The answer should be "Ruby"

// --------------------4) What will this log?

// const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: SATURDAY, SUNDAY
// b) Verify and explain:

//  My guess:

//  I think that it will display in all caps. the variable in the fuction call console.log() had both strings in the array
//  with the .toUpperCase() built-in method that capitalize the elements in the array.

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: 3
// b) Verify and explain:

//  I dont know what "typeof" is suppose to do i never seen it or i don't recall. I didnt see it in the notes but I will assume that,
//  that is what it's going to do.

//  Incorrect

//  The correct answer was "number"

//  I did some research and found out that type of is an operator that find out the data typ. They're strings but I dont know what is
//  making the answer come up with number.
